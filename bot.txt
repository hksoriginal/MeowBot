type i and type ii errors are very common in machine learning and statistics type i error occurs when the null hypothesis (h0) is mistakenly rejected this is also referred to as the false positive error type ii error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually false is accepted.

precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives false positives are cases the model incorrectly labels as positive that are actually negative, or in our example, individuals the model classifies as terrorists that are not .

recall expresses the ability to find all relevant instances of a class in a data set, precision expresses the proportion of the data points our model says existed in the relevant class that were indeed relevant.

a confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

accuracy is the number of correctly predicted data points out of all the data points more formally, it is defined as the number of true positives and true negatives divided by the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

type i and type ii errors are very common in machine learning and statistics type i error occurs when the null hypothesis (h0) is mistakenly rejected this is also referred to as the false positive error type ii error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually false is accepted.

precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives false positives are cases the model incorrectly labels as positive that are actually negative, or in our example, individuals the model classifies as terrorists that are not .

recall expresses the ability to find all relevant instances of a class in a data set, precision expresses the proportion of the data points our model says existed in the relevant class that were indeed relevant.

a false positive is when a scientist determines something is true when it is actually false (also called a type i error) a false positive is a ‚Äúfalse alarm‚Äù.

a false negative means something that is there was not detected; something was missed.

true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class a false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.
